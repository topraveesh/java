The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. 
All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. 
The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, Object, localized characters, etc.

A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. 
The InputStream is used to read data from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.

Basically there are 2 types of Streams: 
    Byte Stream and 
    Character Stream

------------
Byte Stream
------------
Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. 
Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are:
    FileInputStream and 
    FileOutputStream.

 A byte stream access the file byte by byte. 
 A byte stream is suitable for any kind of file, however not quite appropriate for text files. 
 For example, if the file is using a unicode encoding and a character is represented with two bytes, 
 the byte stream will treat these separately and you will need to do the conversion yourself.
It would be very useful when reading the file or socket and write into another sockets or file. 
( Don't need of conversion, but incase of if we use character stream, it needs conversion in both operations)


------------
Character Stream
------------
Java Byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes, 
where as Java Character streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit unicode. 
Though there are many classes related to character streams but the most frequently used classes are , 
    FileReader and 
    FileWriter.

Though internally FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream but here major difference is that 
FileReader reads two bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.
A character stream will read a file character by character. 
A character stream needs to be given the file's encoding in order to work properly.
It would be veryuseful when reading the data and directly so it into user. 
( User can understand only combination of character). 
So that we don't need to explicit conversion from byte into character.
