JAX-WS
------------------------------------
The Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) is a Java programming language API for creating web services.
It is part of the Java EE platform from Sun Microsystems.


JDOM
------------------------------------
JDOM is an open source Java-based document object model for XML that was designed specifically for the Java platform 
so that it can take advantage of its language features. 
JDOM integrates with Document Object Model (DOM) and Simple API for XML (SAX), supports XPath and XSLT.


JAXB
------------------------------------
JAXB stands for Java architecture for XML binding.It is used to convert XML to java object and java object to XML.
JAXB defines an API for reading and writing Java objects to and from XML documents.
Unlike SAX and DOM,we don't need to be aware of XML parsing techniques.


Spring-WS
------------------------------------
Spring Web Services (Spring-WS) is a product of the Spring community focused on creating document-driven Web services. 
Spring Web Services aims to facilitate contract-first SOAP service development, 
allowing for the creation of flexible web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads.


ContractFirst Vs ContractLast Approaches in Webservice:
------------------------------------
contract-first is where you create the WSDL, and then you can create the implementation from this, 
and since the WSDL is your contract, this would be contract-first.

Contract-last is where the WSDL is created from the source code, or implementation, 
so it will most likely be generated by a tool rather than created by the developer.
